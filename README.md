# Spin Paddle - Game Jam Titans
A single player mouse based game or a co-op game. You try to hold a ball inside an area with 4 paddles, fighting as multiple enemies keep spawning.

All art, design and coding responsibilities were handled by me. The entire game was made in 2 months and the prototype was built in 2 days for a game jam competition and is made in Unity.

## Gameplay
You can control the 4 paddles using a mouse.

The bot in the centre should not be allowed to touch the walls or the wall shrinks and spawns even more enemies. 
1.	Press “Play”.
2.	In the customization section where you chose your weapon type, gun type, power up and paddle type.
3.	To get in the game, press the large arrow on the right.
4.	Try and set as high a score as possible by surviving the longest and killing as many enemies (anything except you) as possible.
5.	Don’t die (for as long as you can)

There are:
- 5 Ammo types (Bullets, Grenades, Shotgun, Lancer and Guided Missle)
- 5 Turrets (Quad, Control, Pointer, Tri and MineLayer)
- 5 powerups (Reverse, Boost, Shockwave, Implosion and Freeze)
- 4 paddle types (Bounce, Portal, Destroyer and Helper)

All the ammo, turrets, powerups and paddle types can be used with each other.

## Controls
- Mouse movement to control placement of paddles
- Left click to fire and spin left (if turret type is pointer, fire towards mouse position)
- Right click to fire and spin right (if turret type is pointer, slow down time)
